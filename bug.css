The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you use it incorrectly, it can cause unexpected results.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` works as expected, but `calc(100% - 10px) + 10px` might not work as you expect, because the addition happens *after* the calculation, instead of before, within the context of 100%.  Another example: `calc(100% + 10px)` won't add 10 pixels to the 100% width; instead, it will add 10 pixels to the calculated 100% width. This is a common misconception that leads to unexpected results. Also, be sure to include spaces around operators within `calc()`.  Incorrect use of units can also cause issues.  For instance, mixing percentages and pixels without careful consideration will lead to unpredictable results.  Moreover, nested `calc()` functions can become incredibly complex and hard to debug.
